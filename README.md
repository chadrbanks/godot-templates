This template is made so that you can easily fork it to start a new Godot project.
That project description would go here.

## Versioning

The main branch is still tracking Godot v3.5.x since it is still the recommended version for HTML 5 exports.
The default engine is GLES 2.0 as well.

Note that there are branches in this template called opengl-es3, and opengl-es2 in case you want to target a specific one.

There is also a v4.1 branch available if you would like to try using v4. 
I will merge v4 into main as I get more comfortable with it.
